# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 Challenge

The Stock Analyzer analysis stock data over the years within different worksheets in an Excel workbook using VBA script. 

With the help of VBA script we calculated the following to see the trends:
- Yearly change
- Percentage Change
- Total Stock Volume

In addition, we were abe to gain insights on stock:
- Greatest percentage increase
- Greatest percentage decrease
- Greatest total volume

During the process of creating VBA script, came across useful techniques that helped enhance the functionality and appearance of my code:
- Auto Fill contents of cell
- Number format to pre-defined cell formats
- Conditional formatting 
(These skills were explored from Stack overflow)
